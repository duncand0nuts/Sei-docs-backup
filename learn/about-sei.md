# About Sei

## What is Sei?

Sei is a general purpose, open-source Layer 1 blockchain specialized for the exchange of digital assets. Leveraging a novel consensus and technical breakthroughs, Sei is the fastest blockchain in the industry.&#x20;

A common misconception is that Sei is a DeFi chain. However, the exchange of digital assets is universal across gaming, social, and NFTs. **Trading is general purpose.**

## The Sei Vision

## What problem does Sei solve?

**The fundamental use case of blockchains is the abilty to exchange digital assets**.

The most successful Web3 apps are: 1) Indirect trading apps (most Metamask users ultimately use Uniswap / OpenSea) or 2) Direct trading apps, disguised as a game or NFT marketplace (like Axie or Magic Eden).&#x20;

There are major tailwinds driving the growth of on-chain trading and exchange of digital assets. As regulation increases on centralized exchanges, more activity flows on-chain. As crypto adoption increases, more assets are tokenized and the need to exchange these assets increases exponentially.

Exchanges face a major scaling problem on Layer 1s today. Exchanges face the **Exchange Trilemma**: between decentralization, scalability and capital efficiency, they cannot achieve all three.&#x20;
