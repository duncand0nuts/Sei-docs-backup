# Run a Sei Node

A full Sei node is a fundamental building block of the Sei Blockchain. It consists of a local copy of the entire blockchain, including its history and state. Running a full node is essential for participating in network operations like validating transactions, joining consensus, and broadcasting events to other network participants.
